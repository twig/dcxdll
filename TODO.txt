
DCX V3.1 TODO List

General
	1: add more options to settings command...
	2: update the docs!!! @svn991 so far, becomes 2.0 at 1020 when changed to utf, becomes 3.0 at ???, 3.1 changes added.
	3: add ability to dock a dialog between editbox & static text control in channels/queries/custom
	4: add grid control, maybe...
	5: fix flicker of controls.

Progressbar
	1: Find better way of updating progressbar's positions upon scroll etc...

WebCtrl
	1: WebCtrl has an odd crash, when the object is destroyed & the browser is set as IE11, but not when its set as IE7 (the default). Doesnt crash every time tho, sometimes only on the third try.
	2: webctrl fails with msft edge installed.
		Maybe use WebView2 for msft Edge.

RichEdit

	2: change how control saves text to allow saving to xml.

Link
	1: change control to use WC_LINK instead of WC_STATIC

	1: Find a better way of integrating CustomMenus into mpopup instead of a seperate global setting.

	14: Add glow effect to tab controls with hottrack.

Image
	1: add animated png support maybe...
	2: fix image controls drawing when animated, has flickering, & crashes when using alpha style or when composited.
	  Partial fix for flickering involved not drawing the background before the image (GDI+ issue?)
	  alpha & composited drawing still broken in animations for some reason...

Listview
	1: Add support for more control types in listview items (partially done, needs testing)
		1b: Possibly do away with child controls for listview & instead simply custom draw the item/subitem
