
DCX V3.1 TODO List

1: Find better way of updating progressbar's positions upon scroll etc...
	1b: Possibly do away with child controls for listview & instead simply custom draw the item/subitem
2: Add support for more control types in listview items (partially done, needs testing)
3: Change How we subclass the controls so we instead handle it all when the class is registered & no subclassing is then needed. (mostly done)
4: WebCtrl has an odd crash, when the object is destroyed & the browser is set as IE11, but not when its set as IE7 (the default). Doesnt crash every time tho, sometimes only on the third try.
5: add more options to settings command...
6: update the docs!!! @svn991 so far, becomes 2.0 at 1020 when changed to utf, becomes 3.0 at ???, 3.1 changes added.
7: change how RichEdit control loads text to allow loading from xml.
8: change how RichEdit control saves text to allow saving to xml.
9: rewrite button/check/radio controls to be a single button control that supports diff styles.
  10: fix box controls group disable button (done)
11: change Link control to use WC_LINK instead of WC_STATIC
12: webctrl fails with msft edge installed.
	Maybe use WebView2 for msft Edge.
13: Find a better way of integrating CustomMenus into mpopup instead of a seperate global setting.
