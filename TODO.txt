Dialog

WebCtrl
	1: WebCtrl has an odd crash, when the object is destroyed & the browser is set as IE11, but not when its set as IE7 (the default). Doesnt crash every time tho, sometimes only on the third try.

Edit
	1: add a $xdid().find (mostly done)

Button
	1: rewrite button/check/radio controls to be a single button control that supports diff styles.

Image
	1: add animated png support maybe...

	  Partial fix for flickering involved not drawing the background before the image (GDI+ issue?)
	  alpha & composited drawing still broken in animations for some reason...

Listview
	1: Add support for more control types in listview items (partially done, needs testing)

TreeView
	1: Look for mem leak... (fixed?)
	2: [01:05] <Wims> xdid -v on treeview item needs to be improved so that we can pass a [+FLAG] parameter, if a treeview item is added with bold and you want to remove the bold, you can't, you have to delete and add back, creating a flicker. (done)
	3: [01:05] <Wims> the xdid -a (treeview) example doesn't work correctly.
	4: [01:06] <Wims> using ONLY the two treeview styles hasbuttons + haslines doesn't work (button are not there) (not seen)
		[01:07] <Wims> code to demonstrate can be provided.

Rebar
